## Creating Pages and Sections

Start by creating a clear hierarchy. Use folders for sections like `guides/`, `api/`, and `changelog/`. Add new pages via the dashboard or CLI.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a New Page" icon="file-plus">
    Navigate to your documentation root.

    Click **New Page** and enter a filename like `quickstart.mdx`.

    Add YAML frontmatter immediately:

    ```yaml
    ---
    title: Quickstart Guide
    description: Get started in minutes.
    ---
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Organize into Sections" icon="folder">
    Create a folder for related content:

    ```bash
    mkdir docs/guides
    touch docs/guides/installation.mdx
    ```

    Link sections in your navigation sidebar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Preview Changes" icon="eye">

  </Step>
</Steps>

  Name pages descriptively, like `api-endpoints.mdx`, and use consistent frontmatter for SEO.

## Version Control Basics

Integrate Git to track edits and revert changes. Connect your repository to the documentation space for automatic deploys.

  <Tab title="Initialize Repo" icon="git-branch">
    Set up Git in your docs folder:

    ```bash
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial documentation commit"
    git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/evgeniy-docs.git
    git push -u origin main
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Make Changes" icon="edit-3">
    Edit files and commit:

    ```bash
    git add docs/managing-docs.mdx
    git commit -m "Update managing docs guide"
    git push
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Branch for Features" icon="git-pull-request">
    Work on branches safely:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/new-section
    # Make changes
    git push origin feature/new-section
    ```
  </Tab>
