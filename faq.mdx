## Best Practices for Organization

Organize your documentation effectively to improve collaboration and navigation.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Small Teams" icon="users">
    Use simple folders for projects.

    ```bash
    mkdir docs/projects
    mkdir docs/api
    mkdir docs/guides
    ```

    Limit nesting to two levels to avoid confusion.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Large Teams" icon="building">
    Implement tags and search optimization.

    <CodeGroup tabs="Markdown,JSON">
    ```markdown
    ---
    tags: ["api", "v1.2", "internal"]
    ---

    # API Endpoint
    ```
    ```json
    {
      "tags": ["api", "v1.2", "internal"],
      "search_keywords": ["endpoint", "auth"]
    }
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout kind="info">
  Always use consistent naming conventions, like `{kebab-case}` for file names.
</Callout>

<ExpandableGroup>
  <Expandable title="Advanced Tagging System" default-open="false">
    Create a tag hierarchy: `category/subcategory`. For example, `api/auth` or `guides/onboarding`.

    This enables filtered searches across your documentation space.
  </Expandable>
